In command mode, press *q*

Then select a tag for this macro. I am going to use 1 but any key can be used to save / store the macro.

Do the actions you want in the macro. 

In this example:
* shift+I to go to the beginning of the line. Do a thing
* shift+A to go to the end of the line. Do a thing.
* Then end the macro with q

Now, to use the Macro on a line:
- Hit @ and the macro number, 1

Now to use that on MANY lines:
- Shift+V (line select mode) 
- j, j to select two more lines
- : (range of lines that are already selected) norm (for normal mode)@p (for our macro) 
-
