## THE BIG DIFFERENCES

Superficially, there is one big difference between the two editors. Vi has the concept of a mode. Most commands are just ordinary letters (for example, the I key enters insert mode). The problem with that, of course, is that if you start typing in the wrong mode you either get command characters in your file or you issue lots of random commands.

Emacs works more like a normal text editor. When you type normal characters they go into the current file. Commands use special prefix characters like Control+X or Escape. Sure, you might have a normal letter after a prefix (Control+X C, for example) but thatâ€™s only for the short duration of the command.
