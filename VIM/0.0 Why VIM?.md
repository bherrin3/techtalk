- All of our systems are headless machines and you will need to troubleshoot
- VIM is installed (along with other editors) on these machines
- X11 forwarding isn't setup by default, so using something like gedit to throw a GUI to your desktop from the machine isn't as useful
- There are other useful alternatives (like emacs, nano, cat, grep, pico, etc), but there was desire to learn some more about VIM!
